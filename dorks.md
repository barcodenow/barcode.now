# Dorking

Dorking is a wonderful thing, you can use this technique to search for anything such as index of a website, looking for live online camera server and other specifics, as for dorking commands that you can do for example

1. intitle: Search for specific titles
2. inurl: Search for specific urls or paths
3. intext: Search for specific words or contects
4. filetype: Search for files
5. site: Search from a specified target
6. Wildcard or symbol * (star) Find all web pages, for example: seccodeid*
7. Define:term Search for all things with specified terms, example define:seccodeid
8. cache page Take a snapshot of an indexed page. Google uses this to find the right page for the query you're looking for. Website or target specifically
9. allintext: Searches for specific text contained on a web page
10. allinurl: Find various keywords in a URL
11. allintitle: Restricts results to those containing all terms specified in a title
12. link: List of web pages that have links to the specified URL
13. (|) Pipe. This is a logical operator, | "tips" will show all the sites which contain either, or both words
14. (+) Used to concatenate words, useful to detect pages that use more than one specific key
15. (-) Minus operator avoids showing results that contain certain words, e.g. security -trails will show pages that use "security" in their text, but not those that have the word "trails"
